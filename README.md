# Day 5 

The fifth day of the induction program featured an engaging **Peer-to-Peer** (P2P) learning session conducted by our seniors. The session focused on introducing us to the fundamentals of the **C++ programming language**.

They began by explaining the three primary tools used to represent a program:

1. **Algorithm** – A step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem. The seniors outlined its key steps and structure.

 2. **Pseudocode** – A high-level, plain-language description of a program's logic, written in a format resembling code.

 3. **Flowchart** – A diagrammatic representation of a program’s logic using symbols and arrows to illustrate the process flow.
They highlighted that, among these tools, flowcharts are the most commonly used in practice.

After covering these tools, the seniors introduced basic **C++ programming concepts**, including:

**Common Data Types**: int, float, char, bool, string.

**The cout statement**: Used for output in C++ programs.

### Variable Naming Rules:

- Must begin with a letter or underscore (_).

- Cannot start with numbers.

- Cannot contain spaces or special symbols.

### Difference between Declaration and Initialization:

- Declaration specifies the variable’s name and type.

- Initialization assigns a value to the variable at the time of declaration or later.
### Operators:

- Insertion operator- <<
- Extraction operator- >>

The day concluded with an interactive Q&A session, ensuring that all students had a clear understanding of these foundational programming concepts.

## BEEE & Chemistry Lectures
