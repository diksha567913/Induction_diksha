# My First Experience at GNDEC - Induction Program 

# Day 1 

## Spiritual Start at Gurudwara Sahib

Our first day began on a spiritual note as we visited the **college Gurudwara Sahib**, where we listened to a serene **Shabad Kirtan**. The shape of Gurudwara Sahib of GNDEC, is similar to "ship". We all travel in this ship for almost one hour. The peaceful environment helped calm our nerves and offered a meaningful start to our academic journey.
